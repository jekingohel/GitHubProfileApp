## Features

### User Search

- A search bar enables users to fetch GitHub user profiles by username.
- If no user exists with the provided username, a "Not found" view is presented.
- If the user exists, a view displays the user's:
  - Avatar
  - Username
  - Name
  - Description
  - Follower count
  - Following count

### Followers/Following Lists

- Users can tap on the follower/following counts to navigate to a list view.
- The list view displays the user's followers or the users they are following.
- Tapping on a user in the list navigates to their profile view.

### Navigation

- Users can navigate backward through the navigation stack.

### Skeleton Screens

- Add skeleton screens to provide a visual indication of loading.

### Pull to Refresh

- Implement pull-to-refresh functionality to allow users to manually refresh data.

### Profile Caching & Cache Invalidation

- Implement profile caching to improve app performance.
- Add cache invalidation mechanisms to keep data up-to-date.

## Test Cases

#### User Search

- Verify the presence of the search bar.
- Test searching for a user that exists.
- Test searching for a user that doesn't exist.
- Verify the "Not found" view is displayed appropriately.

#### User Details

- Ensure user details are displayed correctly.
- Test navigating to a user's followers list.
- Test navigating to a user's following list.
- Verify the avatar, username, name, description, follower count, and following count.

#### Followers/Following List

- Test tapping on a follower/following count.
- Verify the list view displays the correct user information.
- Test tapping on a user in the list and verify navigation to their profile view.

#### Navigation

- Test navigating backward through the app.
- Ensure the expected views are displayed after navigation.

## Time Investment
The completion of this project required a thoughtful investment of time. The total hours dedicated to the development, testing, and refinement of the GitHub Profile App amounted to 10 hours.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jekingohel/GitHubProfileApp.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd GitHubProfileApp
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Usage

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Testing

```bash
# using npm
npm test -- -u

# OR using Yarn
yarn test -- -u
```
